        Mr. Mancilla uses advanced problem-solving skills to analyze critical
        factors such as impact angles, crush depths, velocity changes, vehicle
        speeds, and the forces involved in vehicular collisions. Mr. Mancilla is
        also certified to perform{" "}
        <RouteLink href="/services/cdr" label="Event Data Recorder" /> (EDR)
        imaging from vehicles that support it. EDR imaging can yield critical
        information related to vehicle collisions (like pre-impact speed,
        steering angle, and brake usage), and Mr. Mancilla is qualified to
        analyze this data. Additionally, Mr. Mancilla can also use his{" "}

        Mr. Mancilla is also able to use specialized software to create

        included the following types of accidents: automobile vs. automobile;
        automobile vs. pedestrian; slip and fall; trip and fall; and premises
        liability.
