          href="/services/accident_recon"
          label="Accident Reconstruction"
        />{" "}
        as it relates to transportation accidents, premises liability, and
        industrial accidents. For <StyledList items={["traffic accidents"]} />,
        he uses his skills to calculate angles of impact, crush depths,
        delta-V’s, G-forces, and speeds of impact. For{" "}
        <RouteLink href="/services/premises" label="premises liability" /> and
        industrial accidents, he utilizes his knowledge of the UBC, ANSI, and
        OSHA standards to determine liability.{" "}
