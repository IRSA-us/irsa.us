        Mr. Malek’s forensic work spans transportation accidents, industrial
        incidents, criminal investigations, and premises liability. He applies
        principles of physics, dynamics, material science, and risk analysis to{" "}
        <StyledList items={["reconstruct accidents", "assess failures"]} /> in
        complex systems. His analysis routinely involves quantifying impact
        forces, vehicle dynamics, occupant kinematics, and structural
        deformation. In premises liability evaluations, he draws upon his
        extensive knowledge of building codes and safety regulations—including
        CBC, IBC, UBC, ANSI, and OSHA standards—to determine compliance and
        hazard foreseeability.

      <p className="text-center text-xl">
        Mr. Malek employs a systems-based methodology to determine how and why
        failures occur, the nature of those failures, and how they could have
        been prevented or mitigated through alternative design or practice. He
        is also a <StyledList items={["principal instructor"]} /> at IRSA, where
        he teaches courses in accident reconstruction, human factors, and injury
        biomechanics.
