          scanner, one of the devices our Lab utilizes. The scanner provides
          very precise mappings of its environment. First, the laser scanner
          emits a laser beam from a rotating mirror out towards the area being
          scanned. Then, the unit distributes the laser beam to a vertical range
          of 300° and a horizontal range of 360°. The laser beam is then
          reflected to the scanner by the object in its path. The distance to
          the object defining an area is calculated as well as the relative
          vertical and horizontal angles. The data is captured and transmitted
          via WLAN for calculating exact 3D renderings. The Forensic Scientists
          at IRSA are all trained in the proper operation of the 3D scanner.
